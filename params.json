{"name":"Rui Figueiredo","tagline":"Amazing front-end developer","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nHello there, my name is Rui Figueiredo and I'm a front-end developer.\r\n\r\n## Who is this guy?\r\nIâ€™m a geek, a gamer and a web afficionado. I like clean, minimalist designs and I love to turn them into fully functional websites using the latest technologies.\r\n\r\n## What does he do?\r\nBased in Portugal and working as consultant, I help clients across the globe to push their websites to the limit.\r\nIn a nutshell, I turn designs into fully working websites using either Drupal or Wordpress as a back-end platform. This means I get to try out all sorts of neat CSS, HTML and jQuery tricks to get the job done.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
